## Java Email Client  
*(in emailClient folder)*__

This was the first assignment.  

It includes  
1.	A simple editor for inputting email address (including cc), email body and subject.  
2.	Sending email   
3.	A Graphic User Interface (GUI) for all the features listed above.  

In order to run the code, you must also include the [JavaMail](https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home) API. Also, in Init, the user details must be changed to those of the user using the email client.

## Mulithreaded Email Client  
*(in threadAssignment folder)*__

This was the second assignment. It is a multithreaded version of the first assignment. There is  a thread for composing a new message and sending it and another one that checks if messages were received and informs the user if this is the case:
